A while ago I posted a guide on how to send text messages (SMS) from Microsoft OMS (Azure) via GatewayAPI.dk using a webhook.

If you need a fast messaging gateway with tons of nice feature, then I suggest trying out their service!

Anyway, here is the link, please give it a read if you are interrested in how Webhooks are setup within OMS for alerting.
